# Learning-DevOps-2023

This repository is my dumping directory of the things I am learning from a DevOps course. 

The primary sources of these notes are [Aditya Jaiswal](https://github.com/jaiswaladi246), ChatGPT, and my hands-on projects. Notes are modified according to my needs.

Thanks for checking out.
