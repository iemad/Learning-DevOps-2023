# 1) Key Conceptions:

## 1.1 Kernel:
The Linux kernel is the core component of the Linux operating system. It serves as the bridge between the hardware of a computer and the software applications that run on it. The kernel is responsible for managing system processes, memory, devices, file systems, security, networking, system calls, etc. An important aspect of the kernel is that Linux allows changes in kernel modules to extend its functionality without recompiling the entire kernel.

## 1.2 Shell:
A Linux shell is a command-line interface (CLI) or command interpreter for interacting with the Linux operating system. It acts as an intermediary between the user and the Linux kernel, interpreting and executing user commands. Common Linux shells include Bash (Bourne Again Shell), Zsh (Z shell), and others.

## 1.3 File System:
The Linux file system, often referred to as the "file hierarchy" or "directory structure," is the organizational structure used by the Linux operating system to manage and store files and directories on storage devices. Linux supports a variety of file systems including ext4, Btrfs, XFS, and more.

Some common directories found in the Linux file system hierarchy include:
- ***/bin***: Essential system binaries and commands needed for system recovery.
- ***/etc***: Configuration files and system-wide settings.
- ***/home***: User home directories. Each user on the system has a subdirectory within /home for their personal files and settings.
- ***/var***: Variable data, such as logs, spool files, and temporary files generated by system processes and applications.
- ***/tmp***: Temporary files and directories.
- ***/usr***: User and system binaries, libraries, and documentation.
- ***/opt***: Optional software and packages. Some software that is not part of the core system may be installed in /opt.
- ***/dev***: Device files, representing hardware devices.
- ***/mnt***: Mount points for manually mounted storage devices.
- ***/media***: It points to removable media devices, such as USB drives and external hard disks
- ***/proc***: A virtual file system that provides information about running processes.

## 1.4 System Utility:
These are the programs used for tasks like managing files, system configuration, monitoring system performance, and more. Examples include `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, `ps`, `top`, etc.  

## 1.5 Applications and Software Packages:
Linux provides a rich ecosystem of software packages that can be easily installed and managed through package managers. Package managers are essential tools for maintaining and extending the functionality of a Linux system.
- Debian-based distributions (e.g., Debian, Ubuntu) use apt (Advanced Package Tool) and dpkg for package management. You can use commands like apt-get or apt to install, update, or remove packages.
- Red Hat-based distributions (e.g., CentOS, Fedora) use yum (Yellowdog Updater, Modified) or dnf (Dandified YUM). You can use commands like yum or dnf to handle packages.

# 2) Top Linux Commands:

## 2.1 Change Permission of a File or Directory:
Values of changing permission of a file or directory:
- Read (`r`) = 4
- Write (`w`) = 2
- Execute (`x`) = 1
- No permission = 0
  
The command for changing permission: `chmod 755 /path/filename.extension(folder)`

This can be done through the symbolic method too:
- `u` = user (owner)
- `g` = group
- `o` = others
- `a` = all
- `+` = giving permission
- `-` = removing permission
- `r/w/x` = read/write/execute

**Example 1 - Giving user (owner) read and write permission:** `chmod u+rw /path/filename.extension(folder)`

**Example 2 - Removing execution permission from others:** `chmod o-x /path/filename.extension(folder)`

## 2.2 Change Ownership of a File or Directory:
- Changing owner: `sudo chown user_name file/directory`
- Changing group: `sudo chown :group_name file/directory`
- Changing both owner and group: `sudo chown user_name:group_name file/directory`
- Changing both owner and group recursively (for all files and subdirectories): `sudo chown -R user_name:group_name /path/directory`

## 2.3 User Management:
Create and Delete:
- Creating a user (more interactive): `sudo adduser username`
- Creating a user (less interactive): `sudo useradd username`
- Deleting a user: `sudo userdel username`
- Setting password for a user: `sudo passwd username`

Modifying user properties:
* Change username: `sudo usermod -l new_username old_username`
* Change home directory of a user: `sudo usermod -d /new_home_directory username`
* Change default shell for a user: `sudo usermod -s /path/to/new/shell username`

## 2.4 Group Management:
- Creating a group (more interactive): `sudo addgroup groupname`
- Creating a group (less interactive): `sudo groupadd groupname`
- Deleting a group: `sudo groupdel groupname`
- Adding user to an existing group: `sudo usermod -aG groupname username`
- Changing a User's Primary Group: `sudo usermod -g groupname username`

## 2.5 Additional User & Group Management Commands:
- Changing "other user" to "root user": `sudo su`
- Exiting from "root user": `exit`
- List all users: `cat /etc/passwd`
- List all groups: `cat /etc/group`

## 2.6 General Commands:
File and Directory:
- Change directory: `cd`
- List files and directories: `ls -la`
- Print working directory: `pwd`
- Make a new directory: `mkdir`
- Copy a file or directory: `cp file_name /path/to/new/destination`
- Remove a file or directory: `rm a_file`
- Create a file or directory: `touch a_file_folder`
- See what is in a file: `cat file_name`
- Search things from a file: `grep search_keyword file_name`

Package management: 
- For Ubuntu: `apt install package_ name`
- For CentOS: `yum install package_name`

Networking: 
- `ping`
- `netstat`
- `ssh`
- `curl`

Disk: 
- Display disk space usage: `df -h`

System Information: 
- Display uptime: `uptime`

Find and locate: 
- Find: `find /path/to/search -name "*.txt"`
- Locate: `locate file.txt`
  
System Control:
- `reboot`
- `shutdown -h now`
  
Text Editor:
- `nano`
- `vim`
- `vi`

Shell:
- `history`
-  Clears the window: `Ctrl + L`

Others:
- Remote Access: `ssh user@host`
- Display running processes: `ps aux`
- Check live system resource usage: `top`
- Terminate a process: `kill PID`
- Checking software version: `software_name --version`
